In order to test run Anomaly Detection system we have prepared starting script localized in /scripts/run.sh. The script is ready to launch a test job on Torino HPC cluster thanks to ready virtual environment and paths properly set up.
In case of testing Anomaly Detection system outside of Torino HPC one has to prepare virtual environment with Python >= 3.10. Requirements.txt file will help with installation of proper versions of needed libraries.

The main file orchestrating work in Anomaly Detection system is RTDataHandler.py.
Both architecture and results of our systems are shown in a presentation.
